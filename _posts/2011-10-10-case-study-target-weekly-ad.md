# Case Study: Target Weekly Ad

A short description about the post goes here.

## New Section

Some more text. Happy posting!


## Ideas

- Jammit - asset groups, keep javascripts separated and page weight down
- Cucumber - automated acceptance testing, tied into jenkins so we know when the build breaks
- Haml/SASS/Mustache - just sayin, we use the newest hotness
- Custom client-side persistence layer for Quick List - degrades gracefully all the way back to IE5.5
- Git/GitHub (this is actually a huge one)
	- branching - continuing development on phase 2 but maintenance on 1 is a breeze
	- pull requests - continual system of code review for any development that matters
	- readme - perfect place for developer documentation
