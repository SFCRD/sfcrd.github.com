## The Skinny

**sammy.js** is a tiny client-side framework for building web applications.

It features:

- Small footprint (16K)

- Hash-routing (via HTML5 pushState by default)

- Plugins like crazy

This guide will take you through:

- **What** does sammy.js solve?

- **What** does sammy.js leave up to the developer?

- **Why** sammy.js instead of other frameworks?

- **How** do sammy's plugins work?

- **What** are some more advanced techniques for using **sammy.js**?

## What is sammy.js?

**sammy.js** is a lightweight solution for a client-side web framework.

At its core, **sammy.js** is mostly a routing framework. It allows you to attach callbacks to specific routes.

{% highlight js linenos %}
var Application = Sammy( function( )
{
  this.get( '#/', function( )
  {
    alert( "Check out the home page!" );
  } );
} );
{% endhighlight %}

After that, **sammy.js** comes bundled with almost 20 plugins that you can include and use to handle everything from client-side persistence to templating to analytics.

## What doesn't sammy.js do?

Unlike **backbone.js**, there is no model/service layer included with **sammy.js**. This means that you can either roll your own, or if you're RESTful, use something pre-built like [js-model](https://github.com/benpickles/js-model).
