# sammy.js

A small web framework with class.

## The Skinny

**sammy.js** is a tiny client-side framework for building web applications.

It features:

- Small footprint (16K)

- Hash-routing (via HTML5 pushState by default)

- Plugins like crazy

This guide will take you through:

- **What** does sammy.js solve?

- **What** does sammy.js leave up to the developer?

- **Why** sammy.js instead of other frameworks?

- **How** do sammy's plugins work?

- **What** are some more advanced techniques for using **sammy.js**?

## What is sammy.js?

**sammy.js** is a lightweight solution for a client-side web framework.

At its core, **sammy.js** is mostly a routing framework. It allows you to attach callbacks to specific routes.

{% highlight js %}
var Application = Sammy( function( )
{
  this.get( '#/', function( )
  {
    alert( "Check out the home page!" );
  } );
} );
{% endhighlight %}

After that, **sammy.js** comes bundled with almost 20 plugins that you can include and use to handle everything from client-side persistence to templating to analytics.

## What doesn't sammy.js do?

Unlike **backbone.js**, there is no model/service layer included with **sammy.js**. This means that you can either roll your own, or if you're RESTful, use something pre-built like [js-model](https://github.com/benpickles/js-model).

## Comparison to backbone.js

**sammy.js** and **backbone.js** do overlap in their routing functionality so I don't recommend using both libraries together in the same project.

**You might want sammy.js if...**

- your application looks more like a site with pages.

- you have a backend service that isn't exactly RESTful.

**You might want backbone.js if...**

- your application looks more like google docs.

- you have a backend service that is entirely RESTful.

## Let's see some code!

Here's a bare-bones **sammy.js** app with two routes:

{% highlight js %}
var Application = Sammy( function( )
{
  this.get( '#/home', function( )
  {
    alert( "Check out the home page!" );
  } );
  
  this.get( '#/shop', function( )
  {
    alert( "Check out the shop page!" );
  } );
} );
{% endhighlight %}

This app has two routes, `#/home` and `#/shop`. If the browser's hash changes to either of these routes, the corresponding callback will be invoked.

When you're ready to kick off your app, call `Application.run( );`. You can also pass in the default route like `Application.run( '#/home' );`.

### Rendering your pages

These route callbacks are great places to render our content into the page.

{% highlight js %}
var Application = Sammy( function( )
{
  this.get( '#/home', function( )
  {
    $( '#content' ).text( "Check out the home page!" );
  } );
  
  this.get( '#/shop', function( )
  {
    $( '#content' ).text( "Check out the shop page!" );
  } );
} );
{% endhighlight %}

But if our content is any more complicated than that, we should switch to using a templating plugin!

### Templating plugins

**sammy.js** comes with plugins for [mustache.js](https://github.com/janl/mustache.js), [jquery-tmpl](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-tmpl), [EJS](http://embeddedjs.com/), [haml-js](https://github.com/creationix/haml-js), and [pure](http://beebole.com/pure/).

If you don't like any of those, or maybe you're just a purist, **sammy.js** also provides a templating plugin in the style of John Resig's original JavaScript templates.

To use it, you'll first need to include the **Sammy.Template** plugin in your page. Next, you have to tell your sammy app to use it:

{% highlight js %}
var Application = Sammy( function( )
{
  this.use( 'Template' );
  
  this.get( '#/home', function( )
  {
    $( '#content' ).text( "Check out the home page!" );
  } );
  
  this.get( '#/shop', function( )
  {
    $( '#content' ).text( "Check out the shop page!" );
  } );
} );
{% endhighlight %}

Next, we can write a couple templates:

{% highlight html %}
<!-- home.template -->
<h1>The Home Page</h1>
<p>Hey there, internet surfer!</p>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight html %}
<!-- shop.template -->
<h1>The Online Shop</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Our first product</li>
    <li>Our second product</li>
</ul>
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight js %}
var Application = Sammy( function( )
{
  this.use( 'Template' );
  
  this.get( '#/home', function( )
  {
    this.partial( 'home.template' );
  } );
  
  this.get( '#/shop', function( )
  {
    this.partial( 'shop.template' );
  } );
} );
{% endhighlight %}

**sammy.js** will actually load in your templates for you and render them in the context of the app. 

### Route segments

Sometimes our routes have important information in them. **sammy.js** lets us use named segments to match these routes. Let's add a new route for a product in the shop:

{% highlight js %}
var Application = Sammy( function( )
{
  this.use( 'Template' );
  
  this.get( '#/home', function( )
  {
    this.partial( 'home.template' );
  } );
  
  this.get( '#/shop', function( )
  {
    this.partial( 'shop.template' );
  } );
  
  this.get( '#/shop/:product', function( cxt )
  {
    alert( cxt.params.product );
  } );
} );
{% endhighlight %}

Now, if we go to `#/shop/trampolines`, the value of `cxt.params.product` will be **"trampolines"**. 

### Filters

**sammy.js** also lets us put `before`, `after`, and `around` filters on our routes.

`before` filters let us attach behavior to before any route is run. If the callback provided returns `false`, the route will not be run. 

{% highlight js %}
var Application = Sammy( function( )
{
  this.before( function( )
  {
    if( !user.isAllowedToSeeThisPage )
    {
      return false;
    }
  } );
} );
{% endhighlight %}

`after` filters are not so much filters because they occur after the route has already been run, but they can be good for cleaning up the app if you need to.

{% highlight js %}
var Application = Sammy( function( )
{
  this.after( function( )
  {
    this.log( 'route completed!' );
  } );
} );
{% endhighlight %}

`around` filters are perhaps the most helpful of all of the **sammy.js** filters as they are capable of altering routing behavior based on *asynchronous criteria*. 

Consider the case where we have a user that logs into our site, and in doing so gets a session, but we don't want to make them log in before viewing every page. We can wrap all of our routes in an `around` filter that checks for the user's session before allowing them to continue.

{% highlight js %}
var Application = Sammy( function( )
{
  var current_user; // undefined to start
  
  this.around( function( callback )
  {
    // check for the user's session
    if( !current_user )
    {
      // user is not logged in, sign them in somehow!
      $.get( '/session', function( user )
      {
        // we store the user's session
        current_user = user;
        
        // and now they may proceed
        callback( );
      } );
    }
    else
    {
      // user is logged in, carry on
      callback( );
    }
  } );
} );
{% endhighlight %}

### Caching plugins

**sammy.js** comes with a number of plugins for client-side caching. 

All of the different types are under the **Sammy.Store** namespace. The different types are:

- **Sammy.Store.Cookie**: Store client data in a traditional cookie. 

- **Sammy.Store.Data**: Store client data on a DOM node. (*will not persist across page views*)

- **Sammy.Store.LocalStorage**: Store client data in HTML5 LocalStorage.

- **Sammy.Store.Memory**: Store client data in-memory. (*will not persist across page views*)

- **Sammy.Store.SessionStorage**: Store client data in HTML SessionStorage. (*will persist across page views but not after the browser is closed*)

Each **Sammy.Store** can be used straight up, or they can be mixed into your sammy app with the **Sammy.Storage** plugin.

### Forms

By default, **sammy.js** will also bind a route to each one of your forms. This can be confusing at first, but there are actually quite graceful ways to handle it in your app.

Let's say, for example, you've got a simple form on a Rails app, so you're also using Rails UJS. 

If your form is set to post to `/orders`, your sammy app will actually intercept that route and log a 404 warning.

The first thing to do would be to set up the route that sammy expects. Forms `POST`, not `GET`, so we can use that verb in our app too:

{% highlight js %}
var Application = Sammy( function( )
{
  this.post( '/orders', function( cxt )
  {
    alert( "form tried to post!" );
  } );
} );
{% endhighlight %}

We don't actually want to stop the form from posting, nor do we want to manually post the form. We'd rather let Rails UJS work its magic behind the scenes, but we still want to handle the result in our sammy route. 

The `cxt` parameter is a **Sammy.EventContext**, which has a lot of information about the route being hit. For form `POST`s, this includes the form element that triggered the route.

Using `cxt.target`, we can attach a one-off handler for the Rails UJS success and keep everything in our route handler:

{% highlight js %}
var Application = Sammy( function( )
{
  this.post( '/orders', function( cxt )
  {
    $( cxt.target ).one( 'ajax:success', function( event, response )
    {
      if( response.success )
      {
        cxt.redirect( '#/success' );
      }
      else
      {
        alert( "There were errors with your form submission" );
      }
    } );
  } );
} );
{% endhighlight %}
